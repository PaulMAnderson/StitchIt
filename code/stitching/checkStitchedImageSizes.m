% function [out,imSizes]=checkStitchedImageSizes(sectionDir)
%
%
% Purpose
% If the user requested stitching based on stage coordinates then image sizes
% may differ by small amounts. We take this into account by cropping back the
% images to beyond the smallest expected size. This is reasonable to do because
% the required cropping is equivalent to only about 4 microns. This number was 
% obtained empirically on the Basel IMCF system in Jan 2015. Other systems may 
% differ and the properties of the Basel X/Y stage may even change with time. 
% Thus, this function checks if all images are sized correctly and reports back 
% if not. We check all images since it only takes a couple of seconds for 
% one thousand tiffs.
%
%
% Inputs
% sectionDir - string to the directory containing the stitched image files
% 
%
% Outputs
% out - the number of images that differ from the mode size. zero means all
%       images are the size.
% imSizes - an n-by-2 matrix of image sizes
